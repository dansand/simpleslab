## 2D thermo mechanical subduction models

This notebook develops a simple, flexible model for 2d subduction using Underworld2. All functionality is parallel-compatible. The code has been run on 48 processors, at a vertical resolution of 256 elements (Q1).


Some of the features of this model:

* use markerLines and 'proximity' to impose geometry / thermal structure
* easy switch between thermal and compositional models
* checkpointing
* command line arguments can be supplied to control parameters and modelling choices
